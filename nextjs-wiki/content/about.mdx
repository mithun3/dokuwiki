# 🎵 About sysya

## The Artist Name

**sysya** — it means "disciple."

At its core, being a disciple means being a *learner*, an *apprentice*. But in the modern day, the concept of universal discipleship carries deeper weight: every individual is a student of existence, constantly being shaped by environment, relationships, and the broader universe. Life is not a series of isolated events—it's a continuous process of learning and transformation.

*"sysya" is me, "sysya" is you.* It's a name that represents the perpetual student, the one who never stops listening, recording, and growing.

## Concept & Origin

I was a kid when I first wondered: *how does someone get inside the radio and sing?*

That childhood magic never left. Music became my first love — not as a casual listener, but as someone obsessed with how sound *works*. Every technical layer fascinated me: arrangement, synthesis, production, the physics of recording itself. I learned keyboards, synthesizers, arrangement. I fell into production. I became obsessed with **capturing sound in its purest form**.

## The Craft

Over decades, I've worked across the full spectrum of audio:

### 🎹 **Music & Production**
- Keyboards and synthesizer design
- Arrangement and composition  
- Production across multiple genres (no bias — I love it all)
- Live music mixing and band production

### 🎙️ **Recording: Everywhere**
I record *everywhere*. Not just studios:
- Live performances and buskers
- String quartets and chamber groups
- Field ambience and location recordings
- **Electromagnetic recordings** (the invisible sounds around us)
- **Ultrasonic recordings** (beyond human hearing)
- Birds, nature, urban soundscapes
- Every sonic texture I encounter

The best recordings happen where you *find* them, not where you *expect* them.

### 🛠️ **The Builder's Path**
I don't just use equipment — I architect it:
- Built recording rigs for musicians
- Designed audio interfaces and monitoring systems
- Constructed complete studios from ground up
- Assembled HiFi listening systems (HD600 → HD6xx → Focal Bathys, Yamaha speakers, Kenwood systems)
- Studio technical knowledge across live and recorded environments
- Equipment selection and optimization for purpose

### 📸 **The Adventure Connection**
Photography, mountaineering, hiking, 4WD, traveling — these aren't separate from music. They're **the same pursuit**:

Finding sonic experiences in unexpected places. Capturing the untouched soundscape of a mountain pass. Recording ambient texture in a remote valley. The emotional resonance of a location's *sound*.

## By Day & By Night

**By day:** I'm a programmer navigating the corporate world.

**By night (and weekends, and mountains):** I'm an audio architect, obsessed with:
- How sound *behaves*
- How to *capture* it authentically  
- How to *build tools* that help others do the same
- Finding sonic magic in forgotten places

This library is the intersection of all these passions: **technical depth, artistic vision, and the relentless pursuit of authentic sound**.

## Why I Built This Wiki

You don't need expensive gear or famous studios to make extraordinary recordings. You need:
- **Knowledge** — Understanding the fundamentals
- **Tools** — Whether simple or sophisticated  
- **Curiosity** — Willingness to record everywhere
- **Discipline** — Technical rigor applied to every capture

This wiki documents the path from wondering "how does sound work?" to building your own equipment, recording your own experiences, and trusting your ear above all else.

## The Gear That Shaped My Ear

Decades of listening through:
- **Sennheiser HD600 → HD6xx** (reference quality)
- **Focal Bathys** (modern mastering reference)
- **Audio-Technica AT-PRO70** (portable reality check)
- **Sony MDR-60 & HD25** (field recording monitors)
- **Yamaha H7 & Kenwood systems** (room monitoring)
- **Radio Shack headphones** (reminder that good sound isn't always expensive)

Every pair of headphones taught me something different. Every speaker system showed me how recordings translate to different environments.
