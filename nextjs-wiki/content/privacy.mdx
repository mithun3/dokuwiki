# Privacy Policy 🛡️

**Privacy is a very personal thing.** I respect your privacy, and I've designed this wiki to minimize data collection wherever possible.

**The reality:** This wiki operates in **almost complete privacy mode**. What you do here stays private&mdash;with one transparent exception: comments.

---

## Privacy Commitment

This application **does not collect, store, or transmit any of your personal data** to my servers or any third-party service, with one deliberate exception explained below.

Your activity remains entirely your own&mdash;**except when you choose to comment**.

## 📍 Where Data Is Actually Stored: Comments via Giscus

### The Trade-off I Made

I wanted a completely stateless wiki with zero data collection. But I also wanted community engagement and feedback.

**The honest truth:** Comments require data storage. There&rsquo;s no way around it.

I chose **Giscus** (GitHub Discussions-powered comments) because it's the most transparent, privacy-respecting option available:

### What Gets Stored When You Comment

If you choose to comment on a page:
- **Your username** &mdash; from your GitHub account (you control this)
- **Your comment text** &mdash; the content you write
- **Timestamp** &mdash; when you posted
- **Your GitHub avatar** &mdash; displayed next to your comment

### Where It&rsquo;s Stored

All comment data is stored in **GitHub Discussions** in our public repository:
- Location: https://github.com/mithun3/dokuwiki/discussions
- Access: Completely transparent and searchable
- Ownership: You own your comments; you can delete them anytime
- Visibility: Public (unless GitHub makes discussions private)

### Important Notes About Giscus Comments

✅ **What Giscus does NOT do:**
- ❌ Does not track you across websites
- ❌ Does not collect browsing history
- ❌ Does not serve targeted ads
- ❌ Does not share data with third parties
- ❌ Does not require an email address (uses GitHub auth)
- ❌ Does not store comment data on my servers

✅ **What you control:**
- Comments are optional &mdash; you don&rsquo;t have to comment
- Requires GitHub login &mdash; you choose whether to authenticate
- You can delete your comments anytime
- Your comment data is stored in GitHub, which you can review directly

### Why I Chose Comments

I believe community feedback makes this wiki better. Comments let you:
- Share your own knowledge and experience
- Ask questions specific to each topic
- Help future readers with your insights
- Engage directly without leaving the site

**But I understand** — if you prefer not to comment, that's completely fine. Commenting is 100% optional.

### A Note About GitHub Authentication

You may wonder: **&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not a developer. Why would I create a GitHub account just to comment?&rdquo;**

Fair question. Here&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s worth it:

**1. Better Community Quality**
- Ties comments to real identity (reduces spam and trolling)
- GitHub account shows your profile history
- Natural accountability encourages thoughtful comments

**2. You Get Benefits**
- One login works across thousands of websites using Giscus
- Your GitHub profile builds over time
- You can participate in other projects&rsquo; discussions

**3. GitHub is More Than Coding**
- Not just for developers&mdash;anyone can create an account
- Millions of non-programmers use it for documentation, writing, collaboration
- Takes 2 minutes to sign up with just an email

**4. Privacy-Respecting**
- No email collection from Giscus
- GitHub handles authentication (I never see your password)
- You control your public profile information

**The bottom line:** If you have valuable insights to share, a GitHub account is a small investment that improves the quality of community discussions. If you&rsquo;d rather just read, that&rsquo;s perfectly fine too.

## 🔒 Everything Else: Zero Data Collection

Beyond comments, this wiki truly is stateless:

### What Happens Locally

The only data stored on your device is your media player preferences:
- **Playback volume** &mdash; saved in your browser&rsquo;s local storage
- **Last played position** &mdash; helps you resume where you left off
- **Player UI preferences** &mdash; your viewing choices

This data:
- ✅ Never leaves your device
- ✅ Never synced to any server
- ✅ Only exists in your browser
- ✅ Can be cleared anytime via browser settings

### What We Don&rsquo;t Do

We intentionally **do not**:
- ❌ Collect usage analytics
- ❌ Track page visits
- ❌ Monitor user behavior
- ❌ Install cookies (except session-only browser defaults)
- ❌ Use Google Analytics, Vercel Analytics, or any tracking service
- ❌ Create user profiles
- ❌ Sell or share any data
- ❌ Serve targeted ads
- ❌ Store anything on my servers (except comments you choose to make)

### Why This Design?

This is a **static site** generated at build time. There's no backend server tracking you, no database logging your activity, and no analytics infrastructure. It's architecturally impossible to collect most data even if I wanted to.

The only data that gets stored anywhere is what you explicitly choose to share via comments.

## 🎯 My Philosophy

I want to be radically transparent about data:

1. **Stateless by default** — Nothing tracked, nothing stored on my servers
2. **Transparent about exceptions** &mdash; When you comment, you know exactly where it goes
3. **You own your data** &mdash; Comments are in a public GitHub repo you can see
4. **Easy to opt-out** &mdash; Just don&rsquo;t comment (you&rsquo;ll still enjoy the full wiki)
5. **No hidden tracking** &mdash; What you see is what you get

---

## Your Control

### For Comments
- Don&rsquo;t want to comment? You don&rsquo;t have to
- Want to delete your comment? Go to GitHub Discussions and delete it
- Want to review your data? Visit: https://github.com/mithun3/dokuwiki/discussions

### For Local Storage (Media Player)
- Open DevTools &mdash; Application &mdash; Local Storage
- Clear the entry for this domain whenever you wish
- Your player state resets immediately

That&rsquo;s it. You have complete visibility and control over all your data.

---

## Updates to This Policy

Our privacy commitment won&rsquo;t change:
- We won&rsquo;t add analytics or tracking
- We won&rsquo;t use your comment data for anything other than displaying comments
- If we ever add new features that involve data processing, we&rsquo;ll be fully transparent
