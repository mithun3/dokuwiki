# Privacy Policy 🛡️

**This wiki operates in complete privacy mode.** What you do here stays private.

## Data Collection: Zero ✅

This application **does not collect, store, or transmit any of your personal data** to our servers or any third-party service. Zero analytics, zero tracking, zero telemetry.

Your activity remains entirely your own.

## What Happens Locally

The only data stored on your device is your media player preferences:
- **Playback volume** — saved in your browser's local storage
- **Last played position** — helps you resume where you left off
- **Player UI preferences** — your viewing choices

This data:
- ✅ Never leaves your device
- ✅ Never synced to any server
- ✅ Only exists in your browser
- ✅ Can be cleared anytime via browser settings

## What We Don&rsquo;t Do

We intentionally **do not**:
- ❌ Collect usage analytics
- ❌ Track page visits
- ❌ Monitor user behavior
- ❌ Install cookies (except session-only browser defaults)
- ❌ Use Google Analytics, Vercel Analytics, or any tracking service
- ❌ Create user profiles
- ❌ Sell or share any data
- ❌ Serve targeted ads

## Why This Design?

This is a **static site** generated at build time. There&rsquo;s no backend server tracking you, no database logging your activity, and no analytics infrastructure. It&rsquo;s architecturally impossible to collect data even if we wanted to.

Pure content delivery. Pure privacy.

## Your Control

Since only your browser stores playback preferences:
- Open DevTools → Application → Local Storage
- Clear the entry for this domain whenever you wish
- Your player state resets immediately

That&rsquo;s it. You have complete visibility and control.

## Updates to This Policy

Our privacy commitment won&rsquo;t change. If we ever add features that involve data processing, we&rsquo;ll be transparent about what and why.
