Field recording is easy to start with a lightweight kit. This page is
pre-baked so the wiki works without running the installer.

## In-Depth Guides

  techniques (X/Y, ORTF, M/S, Blumlein), room acoustics, and digital
  recording considerations

  staging, file management, backup strategies, monitoring, and quality
  control

## Quick Checklist

- Recorder with XLR inputs (Zoom H5/H6 or Tascam DR-40X)
- Two matched cardioid mics (or the built-in XY pair)
- Closed-back headphones
- Wind protection: deadcat + foam
- Extra SD card and batteries

## Setup

1.  24-bit/48 kHz WAV
2.  Low-cut at 80--100 Hz to tame rumble
3.  Peaks around -12 dBFS
4.  Monitor with headphones; disable limiter unless needed

## Mic Placement

- \*Ambience\*: XY mics forward at chest height; avoid hard surfaces
  behind you.
- \*Foley/objects\*: mics 30--60 cm from source; angle 90° to reduce
  plosives.
- \*Vehicles\*: stay upwind; lower gain before pass-bys.

## File Hygiene

- Name takes 'YYYYMMDD_location_subject_take.wav'.
- Keep 'notes' with weather, gain, retries.
- Light normalization only; avoid heavy EQ/NR on masters.
- Export an MP3 preview at -14 LUFS; keep WAVs untouched.

## Publishing

- Host WAVs on S3/CloudFront.
- Link to packs here; embed the preview.
- Add a client-side PayPal donate button on the pack page.

Replace the placeholder images by adding real files under 'recording/'
