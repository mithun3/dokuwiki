# Recording Best Practices

*This page is being updated. The content contains formatting that needs manual conversion.*

## Quick Reference

### Pre-Session Preparation
- Battery check and full charge
- Format storage media in recording device
- Test all cables end-to-end
- Check for firmware updates (not before critical sessions)
- Site survey for noise sources

### Gain Structure
- Target peak levels: -18dBFS to -12dBFS
- 24-bit recording: -18dBFS RMS, peaks at -6dBFS
- 32-bit float: More forgiving, but maintain reasonable levels

### Backup Strategy (3-2-1 Rule)
- **3 copies** of data
- **2 different media** types
- **1 off-site** backup

### Monitoring Standards
- Calibrate to 85dB SPL with -20dBFS pink noise
- Use closed-back headphones for field recording
- Minimum frequency response: 50Hz-20kHz
