# Recording Best Practices: Industry Standards & Professional Workflows

## Introduction

This guide compiles decades of professional recording wisdom, covering
everything from pre-session preparation to file delivery. Following
these best practices ensures consistent, high-quality results and smooth
collaboration with clients, editors, and post-production teams.

## Pre-Session Preparation

### Equipment Verification

\*The Day Before Recording:\*

1.  \*Battery Check\*
2.  Charge all rechargeable batteries to 100%
3.  Test battery capacity under load
4.  Carry 2-3x the expected battery requirement
5.  Include backup disposable batteries (lithium preferred for
    temperature stability)


1.  \*Storage Media\*
2.  Format cards in the recording device, not computer
3.  Use high-quality SD cards (SanDisk Extreme Pro, Sony Tough series)
4.  Verify write speeds exceed recorder requirements
5.  Carry minimum 2x expected storage capacity


1.  \*Cable Testing\*
2.  Test every cable end-to-end with audio signal
3.  Flex cables while testing to reveal intermittent faults
4.  Label cables with length and last test date
5.  Replace any cable showing degradation


1.  \*Firmware Updates\*
2.  Check manufacturer websites for updates
3.  Never update firmware the day of a critical session
4.  Test updates on non-critical recordings first
5.  Maintain rollback capability

### Environment Assessment

\*Site Survey Checklist:\*

- \[ \] Identify and eliminate noise sources (HVAC, refrigerators,
  electronics)
- \[ \] Test for electrical interference (ground loops, RF)
- \[ \] Assess room acoustics and reflection points
- \[ \] Identify power outlets and verify circuit capacity
- \[ \] Note ambient noise floor at different times of day
- \[ \] Plan microphone positions and cable runs

## Gain Structure & Level Setting

### The Complete Signal Chain

Proper gain staging through the entire signal path is critical for
optimal signal-to-noise ratio and headroom.

\*Stage 1: Microphone to Preamp\*

- Set preamp gain for healthy signal without clipping
- Target peak levels at -18dBFS to -12dBFS
- Leave headroom for unexpected transients

\*Stage 2: Preamp to A/D Converter\*

- Many modern devices combine these stages
- Ensure converter is not clipped even if preamp meters show headroom
- Watch for inter-sample peaks on digital meters

\*Stage 3: Digital Recording Level\*

- 24-bit recording: Target -18dBFS RMS, peaks at -6dBFS
- 32-bit float recording: Level less critical, but maintain reasonable
  levels
- Never normalize during recording

### The -18dBFS Standard

Professional studios align to -18dBFS = 0 VU for several reasons:

1.  \*Plugin Sweet Spot\*: Most audio plugins are designed for this
    level
2.  \*Headroom\*: Provides 18dB of headroom for transients
3.  \*Analog Emulation\*: Matches the operating level of analog
    equipment
4.  \*Mixing Consistency\*: Prevents fader cramming and bus overloads

### Limiter Configuration

\*Hardware Limiter Settings:\*

- Enable limiters as safety nets, not primary gain control
- Set threshold 3-6dB below digital maximum
- Use fast attack (0.1-1ms) to catch transients
- Set release appropriately for source material
- Ratio: True limiting (∞:1) or heavy compression (20:1)

\*When Limiters Engage:\*

- Occasional limiter activity is acceptable
- Continuous limiting indicates gain is too high
- Review limited sections for quality assessment

## File Management & Naming Conventions

### Professional Naming Standards

\*Broadcast WAV (BWF) Naming Convention:\* ''\`
\[Project\]\_\[Scene\]\_\[Take\]\_\[Description\].\[ext\]

Examples: Documentary_INT01_T03_Interview.wav
Ambience_Forest_T01_Dawn-Chorus.wav SFX_Door_T05_Metal-Slam.wav ''\`

\*Field Recording Naming:\* ''\`
\[Date\]\_\[Location\]\_\[Description\]\_\[Mic/Perspective\].\[ext\]

Examples: 20260118_Sydney_Harbor_Traffic_ORTF.wav
20260118_BlueMountains_Waterfall_Close_MS.wav ''\`

### Metadata Standards

\*Essential BWF Metadata:\*

- Originator: Your name or company
- Originator Reference: Unique identifier
- Description: Detailed description of content
- Time Reference: Timecode stamp
- UMID: Unique Material Identifier

\*Recommended Additional Metadata:\*

- GPS coordinates (for field recordings)
- Equipment used
- Microphone positions
- Weather conditions
- Session notes

### Folder Structure

`` ` Project_Name/ ├── 01_Raw/ │ ├── Day_01/ │ └── Day_02/ ├── 02_Edited/ │ ├── Dialog/ │ ├── Ambience/ │ └── SFX/ ├── 03_Final/ │ ├── Stems/ │ └── Masters/ ├── 04_Documentation/ │ ├── Session_Notes/ │ └── Metadata/ └── 05_Backup/  ``\`

## Backup Strategy

### The 3-2-1 Rule

\*Three Copies:\* Always maintain at least three copies of your data:

1.  Primary working copy
2.  Local backup (external drive)
3.  Off-site backup (cloud or physical location)

\*Two Different Media Types:\*

- Internal SSD + External HDD
- SD Card + NAS
- Cloud + Physical

\*One Off-Site:\*

- Cloud backup (Backblaze, AWS S3, Google Drive)
- Physical drive at separate location
- Automated sync to remote server

### Field Backup Workflow

\*During Recording:\*

- Use dual-card recording when available
- Copy to laptop during breaks
- Never erase cards until verified backup exists

\*End of Day:\*

- Copy all cards to laptop/portable drive
- Verify copies with checksum validation
- Format cards only after double-verification

\*Checksum Verification:\* ''\`bash

# Generate MD5 checksum

md5sum original_file.wav \> checksum.md5

# Verify copy

md5sum -c checksum.md5 ''\`

## Monitoring Standards

### Reference Levels

\*Calibrated Monitoring:\*

- Calibrate monitors to 85dB SPL with -20dBFS pink noise (film standard)
- Alternative: 79dB SPL for nearfield/smaller rooms
- Use SPL meter at listening position

\*Monitor Selection:\*

- Use full-range monitors or monitors with subwoofer
- Minimum frequency response: 50Hz-20kHz (±3dB)
- Position monitors at ear level, forming equilateral triangle

### Headphone Monitoring

\*Field Recording:\*

- Closed-back headphones for isolation
- High impedance (80Ω+) for better noise rejection
- Extended low frequency response essential

\*Recommended Models:\*

- Sony MDR-7506: Industry standard, detailed mids
- Sennheiser HD 25: Durable, excellent isolation
- Audio-Technica ATH-M50x: Extended bass response
- Beyerdynamic DT 770 Pro: Comfortable for long sessions

## Recording Environment Optimization

### Noise Floor Targets

\*Professional Standards:\*

- Music studio: NC-15 to NC-20 (25-30dB SPL)
- Broadcast studio: NC-20 to NC-25 (30-35dB SPL)
- Voice-over booth: NC-15 or lower
- Field recording: Depends on content, generally \<40dB desired

### Electrical Considerations

\*Power Quality:\*

- Use dedicated circuits for audio equipment
- Avoid sharing circuits with lighting dimmers or motors
- Consider power conditioning for sensitive equipment
- Test outlets for proper grounding

\*Ground Loop Prevention:\*

- Star grounding configuration
- Lift grounds systematically to identify problems
- Use balanced connections wherever possible
- DI boxes with ground lift for instruments
