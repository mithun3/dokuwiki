## About

By day, I navigate the corporate world. By night, I'm a freelance audio consultant—specializing in recording, sound design, and field audio work. Whether it's remote capture, on-location spot recording, or immersive ambient soundscaping, I bring studio-grade discipline and creative insight to every project. This library reflects multiple decades of field expertise, gear knowledge, and the sonic techniques that separate good recordings from exceptional ones.
