===== Quick Checklist =====

  * Recorder with XLR inputs (Zoom H5/H6 or Tascam DR-40X)
  * Two matched cardioid mics (or the built-in XY pair)
  * Closed-back headphones
  * Wind protection: deadcat + foam
  * Extra SD card and batteries

===== Setup =====

  - 24-bit/48 kHz WAV
  - Low-cut at 80–100 Hz to tame rumble
  - Peaks around -12 dBFS
  - Monitor with headphones; disable limiter unless needed

===== Mic Placement =====

  * *Ambience*: XY mics forward at chest height; avoid hard surfaces behind you.
  * *Foley/objects*: mics 30–60 cm from source; angle 90° to reduce plosives.
  * *Vehicles*: stay upwind; lower gain before pass-bys.

===== File Hygiene =====

  * Name takes 'YYYYMMDD_location_subject_take.wav'.
  * Keep 'notes' with weather, gain, retries.
  * Light normalization only; avoid heavy EQ/NR on masters.
  * Export an MP3 preview at -14 LUFS; keep WAVs untouched.

===== Publishing =====

  * Host WAVs on S3/CloudFront.
  * Link to packs here; embed the preview.
  * Add a client-side PayPal donate button on the pack page.
