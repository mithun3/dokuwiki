====== Recording Field Sounds: Starter Guide ======

Field recording is easy to start with a lightweight kit. This page is pre-baked so the wiki works without running the installer.

===== Quick Checklist =====
  * Recorder with XLR inputs (Zoom H5/H6 or Tascam DR-40X)
  * Two matched cardioid mics (or the built-in XY pair)
  * Closed-back headphones
  * Wind protection: deadcat + foam
  * Extra SD card and batteries

===== Setup =====
  - 24-bit/48 kHz WAV
  - Low-cut at 80–100 Hz to tame rumble
  - Peaks around -12 dBFS
  - Monitor with headphones; disable limiter unless needed

===== Mic Placement =====
  * Ambience: XY mics forward at chest height; avoid hard surfaces behind you.
  * Foley/objects: mics 30–60 cm from source; angle 90° to reduce plosives.
  * Vehicles: stay upwind; lower gain before pass-bys.

===== File Hygiene =====
  * Name takes `YYYYMMDD_location_subject_take.wav`.
  * Keep `notes` with weather, gain, retries.
  * Light normalization only; avoid heavy EQ/NR on masters.
  * Export an MP3 preview at -14 LUFS; keep WAVs untouched.

===== Publishing =====
  * Host WAVs on S3/CloudFront.
  * Link to packs here; embed the preview.
  * Add a client-side PayPal donate button on the pack page.

Replace the placeholder images by adding real files under :recording: in the media manager (or mount content/media/recording in the container).
